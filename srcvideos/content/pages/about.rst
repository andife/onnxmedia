What is onnx.ai/videos?
-----------------------

It is an index of Onnx related media.

Why?
----


The page is meant to be a central place for media like conference videos around Onnx. 
So far (and still) the videos can be found next to our wiki and also at https://www.youtube.com/onnxai.

The page is a **freely** available index of
freely available resources that seek to provide everyone with the
opportunity to learn about ONNX.

The media should be able to be added as simple json files. Content can be links to presentations, 
videos, accessible from all over the world. 

The project uses the code of pyvideo (https://github.com/pyvideo/) as a starting point.
