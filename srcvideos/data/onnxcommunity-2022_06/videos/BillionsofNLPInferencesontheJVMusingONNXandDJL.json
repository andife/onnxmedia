    "description": "This session outlines the recently rolled out Hypefactors' MLOps infrastructure designed for billions NLP inferences a day. The workload serves media intelligence and OSINT use cases. The infrastructure is designed with a Java Virtual Machine-first approach that is enabled by ONNX interop and AWS' Deep Java Library. On top of that, we show how quantization drives further performance optimizations. ",
