    "description": "This session will present an in-production solution that takes advantage of SAS Event Stream Processing and ONNX runtime to support the detection of safety zone violations using computer vision pre-trained ONNX Model and involving multiple cameras. This solution was deployed at the factory edge with an architecture that, using Kubernetes and Kafka, ensures a reliable and stable environment for productionized computer vision solutions complemented with a cloud-centralized infrastructure to monitor, manage and collect information from multiple factories ",
